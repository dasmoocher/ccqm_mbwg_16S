    1. [Sequence Data Summary](#sds)
	2. [Biologically Conserved Position Analysis](#bcp)
	3. [Biologically Variable Position Analysis](#bvp)
	4. [Variant Combination Set Analysis](#vcs)

### [Statistical Analysis](id:sa)
* The statistical analysis can be performed by running the *ccqm_16S_stat_pipe.R* from the command line `R CMD BATCH ccqm_16S_stat_pipe.R` from within the *ccqm_mbwg_16S/stat* directory


### Statistical Data Analysis Summary
Raw data generated by the bioinformatics pipeline is processed for each of the four parts of the statistical analysis listed above.  The script nomenclature indicate which step in the analysis the script is used for.  The *gather* scripts combines the raw data from the individual datasets generated by the bioinformatic pipeline.  The *analysis* perform the statistical analysis for each part.  Finally, the *figure* scripts generate the figures used in the publication.
